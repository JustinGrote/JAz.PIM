# JAz.PIM Privileged Identity Management Activation Module

Provides a friendly wrapper to the Az PIM Cmdlets for self activation and deactivation of roles.

## Usage

See the help on the cmdlets. `Enable-JAzRole` and `Disable-JAzRole` support autocomplete so using these commands with
tab is typically all that you need.
